    APPLICATION : vJoyDemo Project Overview

This project demonstrate writing of a feeder for vJoy. It has a minimal GUI that
enables the user to move Axis X and Axis Y in the range of 0 to 50000 and to press 
and release eight buttons.
The GUI part is separated from the vJoy-related part with the small seam code.


vJoyClient.cpp
    This is the file that you should be interested with. It contains all the functions you need to control and feed the vJoy device.
    Here are the main points of interest:
    - HANDLE hDevice: Global handle to the device. Obtained once then used for all accesses
    - OpenJoystickDevice(): Get the global handle to the vJoy device
    - openDevice(): Wrapper for OpenJoystickDevice(). The global handle updated (not returned)
    - isInstalled(): Tests if vJoy device is installed
    - getDeviceAttrib(): Gets a string holding device version
    - update_device(): Feeds vJoy device with position data.


vJoyDemo.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

vJoyDemo.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
    Contains the code to display the form.

Form1.h
    Contains the implementation of your form class and InitializeComponent() function.
Also includes functions that call functions from vJoyClient.cpp.

AssemblyInfo.cpp
    Contains custom attributes for modifying assembly metadata.
